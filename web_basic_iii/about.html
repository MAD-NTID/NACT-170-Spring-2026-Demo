    <h1>About This Site</h1>
    <p>
      This website started as a tiny idea and somehow grew into a real thing.
      It’s a place for experiments, thoughts, side projects, and the occasional
      late-night inspiration.

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      There wasn’t a grand master plan—just a desire to create. Over time,
      ideas stacked up, code piled on, and this site became a home for all of it.
      Still evolving. Always improving.
