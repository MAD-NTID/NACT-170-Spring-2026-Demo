        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Johhny — part-time overthinker, full-time dream chaser.</p>

        <p>I'm the kind of person who will start a random conversation with a stranger in a coffee shop and somehow end up planning a road trip by the end of it. I believe life is better when it’s a little unpredictable. Routine is fine… but spontaneous midnight drives? Even better.</p>

        <p>By day, I work with tech and creative ideas, constantly building, breaking, and rebuilding things until they feel just right. By night, you’ll probably find me sketching concepts for a project I may or may not actually finish — but hey, starting is half the fun.</p>

        <p>I'm fueled by strong coffee, deep conversations, and the quiet satisfaction of figuring things out on my own. I value loyalty, honesty, and people who laugh at terrible jokes (because I tell a lot of them).</p>

        <p>I'm not perfect — I overthink texts, replay awkward moments in my head, and sometimes chase ideas that are bigger than my current reality. But I’d rather aim too high than stay too safe.</p>

        <p>If I had to sum myself up? Curious mind. Restless soul. Soft heart.</p>

        <p>And I'm just getting started.</p>
